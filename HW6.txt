Access Patterns:
    -sequential
    -random
    -fixed strides

Warm-Cache / Cold-Cache (Page  cache):
    -Did we reboot so that the memory caches are cleared or are they still filled

Metric:
    -Visualization
        -Access Patern - logical page # v fault number

Notes:
   relative_fault = (VirtualFaultAddr - StartVirtAddressForVMA) >> 12 


Four runs: (Cold and warm) * (each access pattern)
